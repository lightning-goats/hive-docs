## Abstract

This document specifies the client-side architecture for Lightning node management — a set of independently installable CLN plugins that enable **any** Lightning node to contract for professional management services from advisors and access the [liquidity marketplace](./07-HIVE-LIQUIDITY.md) (leasing, pools, JIT, swaps, insurance). The client implements the management interface defined in the [Fleet Management](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md) spec without requiring hive membership, bonds, gossip participation, or the full `cl-hive` plugin.

The CLN implementation is structured as **three separate, independently installable plugins**:

| Plugin | Purpose | Standalone? |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **`cl-hive-comms`** | Nostr DM + REST/rune transport, subscription management, Nostr marketplace publishing | ✓ Entry point for commercial customers |
| **`cl-hive-archon`** | DID identity, credentials, dmail, vault | Requires cl-hive-comms |
| **`cl-hive`** | Coordination (gossip, topology, settlements, advisor) | ✓ Standalone; optional comms integration |

A fourth plugin, **`cl-revenue-ops`**, handles local fee policy and profitability and already exists as a standalone tool.

The result: every Lightning node operator — from a hobbyist running a Raspberry Pi to a business with a multi-BTC routing node — can hire AI-powered or human expert advisors for fee optimization, rebalancing, and channel management, AND access the full liquidity marketplace for inbound capacity, JIT channels, swaps, and insurance. **Install cl-hive-comms, access everything.** The client enforces local policy as the last line of defense against malicious or incompetent advisors and liquidity providers. No trust required.

> **LND support** is deferred to a future project. The architecture principles apply equally to an LND companion daemon (`hive-lnd`), but the initial implementation focuses exclusively on CLN plugins.

Two design principles govern the user experience: (1) **cryptographic identity is plumbing** — DIDs, credentials, and signatures are essential infrastructure that operators never see, like TLS certificates; (2) **payment flexibility is mandatory** — advisors accept Bolt11, Bolt12, L402, and Cashu, with Cashu required only for conditional escrow. See [Design Principles](#design-principles) for full details.

## Design Principles

### DID Transparency

DIDs are the cryptographic foundation but **must be invisible to end users**. The onboarding experience is "install plugin, pick an advisor, approve" — not "create a DID, resolve credentials, issue a VC." Specifically:

- **Auto-provisioning:** On first run, if no DID exists, the client automatically creates one via the configured Archon gateway. Zero user action required.
- **Human-readable names:** Advisors are shown by `displayName` (e.g., "Hex Fleet Advisor"), not DID strings. Node identity uses the Lightning node's alias.
- **Alias system:** The client maintains a local alias map (`advisor_name → DID`). All CLI commands accept aliases: `hive-client-authorize --advisor="Hex Fleet Advisor"`.
- **Transparent credential management:** "Authorize this advisor" and "revoke access" — not "issue VC" or "revoke credential."
- **Technical details hidden by default:** `hive-client-status` shows advisor names, contract status, and escrow balance. DID strings only appear with `--verbose` or `--technical` flags.

### Archon Integration Tiers

The Archon integration tiers map directly to **which plugins you install**:

| Tier | Plugins Installed | Identity | DID Verification | Features |
|------|------------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **None** (default) | `cl-hive-comms` only | Nostr keypair (auto-generated) | None | Nostr DM transport, REST/rune, marketplace publishing |
| **Lightweight** | `cl-hive-comms` + `cl-hive-archon` | DID via public Archon network | ✓ (public gateway) | DID verification, credential issuance |
| **Full** | `cl-hive-comms` + `cl-hive-archon` (local node) | DID via local Archon node | ✓ (local) | Dmail, vault, credential issuance, full sovereignty |
| **Hive Member** | `cl-hive-comms` + `cl-hive-archon` + `cl-hive` | Full hive identity | ✓ | Gossip, topology, settlements, fleet coordination |

#### Identity Auto-Provisioning (Zero-Config)

On first run, `cl-hive-comms` handles identity automatically:

- **No npub configured?** Plugin generates a Nostr keypair on first run, stores in plugin datadir. Ready immediately.
- **No DID configured?** Works fine without one (Nostr-only mode). Full transport and marketplace features available.
- **DID configured later?** (via `cl-hive-archon`) DID↔npub binding auto-created.
- **Upgrade path:** Nostr-only → install `cl-hive-archon` → add DID → binding auto-created. No reconfiguration needed.

```ini
# Default config — just cl-hive-comms, zero config required
# npub auto-generated on first run, stored in plugin datadir
```

```ini
# With cl-hive-archon — public Archon gateway (Tier: Lightweight)
hive-archon-gateway=https://archon.technology
```

```ini
# With cl-hive-archon — local Archon node (Tier: Full)
hive-archon-gateway=http://localhost:4224
```

#### Graceful Degradation

The client tries Archon endpoints in order: local node → public gateway → cached credentials. If all fail, the client operates in **degraded mode**: existing credentials are honored (cached), but new credential issuance and revocation checks fail-closed (deny new commands from unverifiable credentials). If no Archon plugin is installed, the system operates in Nostr-only mode (no DID verification, but all transport and marketplace features work).

### Payment Flexibility

The client handles the full payment stack, not just Cashu:

| Method | Use Case | Client Component |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Cashu tokens** | Escrow (conditional payments), bearer micropayments | Built-in Cashu wallet (NUT-10/11/14) |
| **Bolt11 invoices** | Simple per-action payments, one-time fees | Lightning node's native invoice handling |
| **Bolt12 offers** | Recurring subscriptions | Lightning node's offer handling (CLN native, LND experimental) |
| **L402** | API-style access, subscription macaroons | Built-in L402 client |

The Escrow Manager described in this spec handles Cashu-specific operations. The broader Payment Manager coordinates across all four methods based on the advisor's accepted payment methods and the contract terms.

## Motivation

### The Total Addressable Market

The existing protocol suite assumes hive membership. Hive membership requires:
- Running the full `cl-hive` plugin
- Posting a bond (50,000–500,000 sats)
- Participating in gossip, settlement, and PKI protocols
- Maintaining ongoing obligations to other hive members

This is appropriate for sophisticated operators who want the full benefits of fleet coordination. But it limits the addressable market to operators willing to commit capital, infrastructure, and social participation.

The Lightning Network has **~15,000 publicly visible nodes** and an unknown number of private nodes. Most are unmanaged or self-managed with default settings. The operators fall into three categories:

| Category | Estimated Count | Current State | Willingness to Join a Hive |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Hobbyist operators | ~8,000 | Default fees, minimal optimization | Low (too complex, too much commitment) |
| Semi-professional | ~5,000 | Some manual tuning, basic monitoring | Medium (interested but barrier is high) |
| Professional routing nodes | ~2,000 | Active management, custom tooling | High (already sophisticated) |

The hive targets the professional tier (~2,000 nodes). The client targets **everyone** — lowering the barrier from "join a cooperative and post bonds" to "install a plugin and hire an advisor."

### The Value Proposition

**For node operators:**
- Professional management without learning routing optimization
- Pay-per-action or subscription pricing — no bond, no ongoing hive obligations
- Local policy engine ensures the advisor can never exceed operator-defined limits
- Try before you commit — trial periods with reduced scope
- Upgrade path to full hive membership if desired

**For advisors:**
- Access to the entire Lightning node market, not just hive members
- Build verifiable reputation across a larger client base
- Specialize and compete on merit
- No requirement to operate a Lightning node themselves (just need a DID and expertise)

**For the hive ecosystem:**
- Client nodes are the funnel for hive membership
- Advisors serving client nodes generate reputation that benefits the marketplace
- Revenue from client management fees funds hive development
- Network effects: more managed nodes → better routing intelligence → better management → more nodes

### Implementation Focus: CLN First

The initial implementation targets CLN exclusively. CLN's dynamic plugin model makes it ideal for the modular, independently installable plugin architecture described here. LND support (via a Go companion daemon) is deferred to a future project — see [LND Support (Deferred)](#lnd-support-deferred) for details.

| Property | CLN (initial) | LND (future) |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Language | Python (plugins) | Go (companion daemon) |
| Plugin model | Dynamic plugins via JSON-RPC | Companion daemon via gRPC |
| Configuration | `config` file, command-line flags | YAML config |
| Status | **Active development** | **Deferred** |

### Transport Architecture

`cl-hive-comms` implements a **pluggable transport abstraction** so new transports can be added without touching other plugins:

| Transport | Role | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Nostr DM (NIP-44)** | Primary transport for all node↔advisor communication | ✓ Initial implementation |
| **REST/rune** | Secondary — direct low-latency control and relay-down fallback | ✓ Initial implementation |
| **Bolt 8** | Future transport option for P2P encrypted messaging | Deferred |
| **Archon Dmail** | Future transport option via DID messaging | Deferred (requires cl-hive-archon) |

The transport abstraction means `cl-hive-archon` and `cl-hive` never interact with transport directly — they register handlers with `cl-hive-comms`, which routes messages through the appropriate transport.

### Comparison: Plugin Compositions

| Feature | Unmanaged | `cl-hive-comms` only | + `cl-hive-archon` | + `cl-hive` (full member) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Professional management | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Fee optimization | Manual | Via advisor | Via advisor | Via advisor + fleet intelligence |
| Nostr DM transport | ✗ | ✓ (primary) | ✓ | ✓ |
| REST/rune transport | ✗ | ✓ (secondary) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Marketplace publishing | ✗ | ✓ (kinds 38380+/38900+) | ✓ | ✓ |
| DID verification | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dmail / vault | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Gossip participation | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Settlement protocol | ✗ | ✗ (direct escrow only) | ✗ (direct escrow only) | ✓ (netting, credit tiers) |
| Fleet rebalancing | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (intra-hive paths) |
| Bond requirement | None | None | None | 50,000–500,000 sats |
| Identity | None | Nostr keypair (auto) | Nostr + DID | Nostr + DID + hive PKI |

### Minimal Dependencies

The minimum viable setup has two dependencies:

1. **Lightning node** — CLN ≥ v24.08
2. **`cl-hive-comms`** — Single plugin file

That's it. On first run, `cl-hive-comms` auto-generates a Nostr keypair (no configuration required), connects to Nostr relays for DM transport, and is ready to receive advisor commands. No DID setup, no Archon node, no manual key management. A built-in Cashu wallet handles conditional escrow. The node's existing Lightning wallet handles Bolt11/Bolt12/L402 payments.

Add `cl-hive-archon` later for DID identity and credential verification. Add `cl-hive` for full hive membership. Each plugin is independently installable.

---

## DID Abstraction Layer

### Principle: DIDs Are Plumbing

Archon DIDs are the cryptographic backbone of the entire protocol — identity, credentials, escrow, reputation. But operators should **never interact with DIDs directly**. The abstraction layer ensures that all DID operations happen invisibly, like TLS certificates in a web browser.

### Auto-Provisioning

On first run, `cl-hive-comms`:

1. Checks if an npub/Nostr keypair is configured
2. If not, **automatically generates a Nostr keypair** and stores it in the plugin datadir
3. Connects to configured Nostr relays for DM transport
4. Logs: `"Hive comms initialized. Nostr identity created."`

No DID is required at this stage. The node operates in **Nostr-only mode** — full transport and marketplace features, no DID verification.

If `cl-hive-archon` is installed later:
1. Checks if a DID is configured
2. If not, auto-provisions a DID via the configured Archon gateway
3. Creates a DID↔npub binding automatically
4. Logs: `"DID identity created and bound to Nostr key."`

```bash
# Minimal setup — just cl-hive-comms:
lightning-cli plugin start cl_hive_comms.py
# → Nostr keypair generated, stored in ~/.lightning/cl-hive-comms/
# → Ready for advisor connections via Nostr DM

# Later, add DID identity:
lightning-cli plugin start cl_hive_archon.py
# → DID auto-provisioned, bound to existing npub
# → DID verification now available
```

For operators who already have a Nostr key or Archon DID:

```bash
# Import existing Nostr key
lightning-cli hive-comms-import-key --nsec="nsec1..."

# Import existing DID (requires cl-hive-archon)
lightning-cli hive-archon-import-identity --file=/path/to/wallet.json
```

### Alias Resolution

Every DID in the system gets a human-readable alias. The client maintains a local alias registry:

| Internal | User Sees |
|----------|-----------|
| `did:cid:bagaaierajrr7k...` | `"Hex Fleet Advisor"` |
| `did:cid:bagaaierawhtw...` | `"RoutingBot Pro"` |
| `did:cid:bagaaierabnbx...` | `"my-node"` (auto-assigned) |

Aliases come from three sources (priority order):
1. **Local aliases** — Operator assigns names: `lightning-cli hive-client-alias set hex-advisor "did:cid:..."`
2. **Profile display names** — From the advisor's `HiveServiceProfile.displayName`
3. **Auto-generated** — `"advisor-1"`, `"advisor-2"` for unnamed entities

Aliases are used in **all** user-facing output:

```bash
$ lightning-cli hive-client-status

Hive Client Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Identity: my-node (auto-provisioned)
Policy: moderate

Active Advisors:
  Hex Fleet Advisor
    Access: fee optimization
    Since: 2026-02-14 (30 days remaining)
    Actions: 87 taken, 0 rejected
    Spending: 2,340 sats this month

  RoutingBot Pro
    Access: monitoring only
    Since: 2026-02-10 (24 days remaining)
    Actions: 12 taken, 0 rejected
    Spending: 120 sats this month

Payment Balance:
  Escrow (Cashu): 7,660 sats
  This month's spend: 2,460 sats (limit: 50,000)
```

No DIDs anywhere. No credential IDs. No hashes. Just names, numbers, and plain English.

### Simplified CLI Commands

Every CLI command uses aliases, not DIDs:

```bash
# What the spec defines (internal/advanced):
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize --advisor-did="did:cid:bagaaiera..." --template="fee_optimization"

# What operators actually type:
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "Hex Fleet Advisor" --access="fee optimization"

# Or even simpler, from discovery results:
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize --advisor=1 --access="fee optimization"
# (where "1" is the index from the last discovery query)
```

The `--access` parameter maps to credential templates using natural language:

| User Types | Maps To Template |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `"monitoring"` or `"read only"` | `monitor_only` |
| `"fee optimization"` or `"fees"` | `fee_optimization` |
| `"full routing"` or `"routing"` | `full_routing` |
| `"full management"` or `"everything"` | `complete_management` |

Similarly for revocation:

```bash
# Instead of:
lightning-cli hive-client-revoke --advisor-did="did:cid:badactor..."

# Operators type:
lightning-cli hive-client-revoke "Hex Fleet Advisor"

# Or emergency lockdown:
lightning-cli hive-client-revoke --all
```

### Discovery Output

Discovery results hide all cryptographic details:

```bash
$ lightning-cli hive-client-discover --capabilities="fee optimization"

Found 5 advisors:

#  Name                  Rating  Nodes  Price         Specialties
─  ────                  ──────  ─────  ─────         ───────────
1  Hex Fleet Advisor     ★★★★★   12     3k sats/mo    fee optimization, rebalancing
2  RoutingBot Pro        ★★★★☆   8      5k sats/mo    fee optimization
3  LightningTuner        ★★★☆☆   3      2k sats/mo    fee optimization, monitoring
4  NodeWhisperer         ★★★★☆   22     8k sats/mo    full-stack management
5  FeeHawk AI            ★★★☆☆   5      per-action    fee optimization

Payment methods: All accept Lightning (Bolt11). #1, #4 also accept Bolt12 recurring.
Trial available: #1, #2, #3, #5

Use: lightning-cli hive-client-authorize <number> --access="fee optimization"
```

No DIDs. No credential schemas. No Archon queries visible. Just a ranked list with actionable next steps.

### What Stays Visible (Advanced Mode)

For power users and developers, raw DID/credential data is always accessible:

```bash
# Show full identity details (advanced)
lightning-cli hive-client-identity --verbose

# Show raw credential for an advisor
lightning-cli hive-client-credential "Hex Fleet Advisor" --raw

# Manually specify DID (bypasses alias resolution)
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize --advisor-did="did:cid:bagaaiera..." --template="fee_optimization"
```

The `--verbose` and `--raw` flags expose the cryptographic layer for debugging, auditing, and integration with other DID-aware tools. But the default output is always human-readable.

### Implementation Notes

The abstraction layer is implemented as a thin wrapper around the Archon Keymaster library:

```python
class IdentityLayer:
    """Invisible DID management. Users never interact with this directly."""

    def __init__(self, data_dir):
        self.keymaster = BundledKeymaster(data_dir)
        self.aliases = AliasRegistry(data_dir / "aliases.json")

    def ensure_identity(self):
        """Auto-provision DID on first run. No user action needed."""
        if not self.keymaster.has_identity():
            did = self.keymaster.create_identity()
            self.aliases.set("my-node", did)
            log.info("Node identity created.")
        return self.keymaster.get_identity()

    def resolve_advisor(self, name_or_index):
        """Resolve human input to a DID. Accepts names, indices, or raw DIDs."""
        if isinstance(name_or_index, int):
            return self.last_discovery_results[name_or_index - 1].did
        if name_or_index.startswith("did:"):
            return name_or_index  # passthrough for advanced users
        return self.aliases.resolve(name_or_index)

    def display_name(self, did):
        """Convert DID to human-readable name."""
        alias = self.aliases.get(did)
        if alias:
            return alias
        profile = self.profile_cache.get(did)
        if profile and profile.display_name:
            return profile.display_name
        return did[:20] + "..."  # last resort: truncated DID
```

## Payment Manager

### Overview

The Payment Manager handles all payment flows between operator and advisor. It supports **four payment methods**, choosing the right one based on the payment context:

| Method | Use Case | Conditional? | Requires |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Bolt11** | Simple per-action payments, one-time subscription fees | No | Node's Lightning wallet |
| **Bolt12** | Recurring subscriptions, reusable payment codes | No | Bolt12-capable node (CLN native, LND via plugin) |
| **L402** | API-gated access, subscription macaroons | No | L402 middleware (bundled) |
| **Cashu** | Conditional escrow (payment-on-completion) | Yes (NUT-10/11/14) | Built-in Cashu wallet |

### Payment Method Selection

The client selects the payment method based on the situation:

```
Is this a conditional payment (escrow)?
  YES → Cashu (only option for conditional spending conditions)
  NO  → Use operator's preferred method:
        ├─ Subscription? → Bolt12 offer (if supported) or Bolt11 invoice
        ├─ Per-action?   → Bolt11 invoice or L402 macaroon
        └─ Flat fee?     → Bolt11 invoice
```

**Configuration:**

```ini

### Bolt11 Payments (Standard Lightning Invoices)

The simplest and most widely supported payment method. Used for:
- Per-action fees (advisor presents invoice, client pays automatically within spending limits)
- Flat-fee trial periods
- One-time subscription payments

```

  │                                │                          │
  │                                │  6. Payment confirmed    │

  │                                │                          │

  │  ◄────────────────────────────  │                          │
```

**Advantage:** Works with every Lightning node. No Cashu wallet needed for simple payments.

**Limitation:** Not conditional — once paid, the payment is final regardless of task outcome. Suitable for low-danger actions (score 1–4) where the cost of failure is low.

### Bolt12 Payments (Recurring Offers)

For subscription-based management contracts. The advisor publishes a Bolt12 offer; the client pays it on a recurring schedule.

```
Advisor                          Client
  │                                │
  │  1. Contract includes          │
  │     Bolt12 offer string        │
  │  ──────────────────────────►   │
  │                                │
  │     2. Client stores offer     │
  │     3. Auto-pays monthly       │
  │        (within spending limits) │
  │                                │
  │  [Each month:]                 │
  │  4. Client fetches invoice     │
  │     from offer                 │
  │  ──────────────────────────►   │
  │                                │
  │  5. Invoice returned           │
  │  ◄────────────────────────────  │
  │                                │
  │  6. Client pays               │
  │  ──────────────────────────►   │
  │                                │
```

**Advantage:** Recurring payments without manual intervention. Reusable — same offer for the entire contract duration. Privacy-preserving (Bolt12 blinded paths).

**Limitation:** Requires Bolt12 support. CLN has native support. LND support via experimental flag or plugin. Not conditional.

### L402 Payments (API-Gated Access)

For API-style access patterns where the advisor provides an HTTP endpoint:

```
Advisor (HTTP API)               Client
  │                                │
  │  1. Request resource           │
  │  ◄────────────────────────────  │
  │                                │
  │  2. HTTP 402 + Lightning       │
  │     invoice + macaroon stub    │
  │  ──────────────────────────►   │
  │                                │
  │     3. Pay invoice             │
  │     4. Receive L402 macaroon   │
  │        (valid for N actions    │
  │         or T time period)      │
  │                                │
  │  5. Subsequent requests with   │
  │     L402 macaroon              │
  │  ◄────────────────────────────  │
  │                                │
```

**Advantage:** Familiar HTTP API pattern. Macaroon caveats can encode permission scope (mirroring credential constraints). Efficient for high-frequency monitoring queries.

**Limitation:** Requires HTTP connectivity to advisor (not P2P). Best suited for monitoring-heavy advisors with web dashboards.

### Cashu Escrow (Conditional Payments)

Used exclusively for conditional payments where payment must be contingent on task completion. See [Section 7: Escrow Management](#7-escrow-management-client-side) for the full protocol.

**When Cashu escrow is required:**
- Danger score ≥ 3 (configurable, default: 3)
- Performance-based compensation (bonus payments)
- Any action where the operator wants payment-on-completion guarantees

**When Cashu escrow is optional:**
- Danger score 1–2 (monitoring, read-only)
- Flat-fee subscriptions
- Trusted advisors with established reputation (operator can configure to skip escrow)

### Payment in the HiveServiceProfile

Advisors advertise accepted payment methods in their service profile (extending the [Marketplace spec](./04-HIVE-MARKETPLACE.md#hiveserviceprofile-credential)):

```json
{
  "pricing": {
    "models": [
      {
        "type": "per_action",
        "baseFeeRange": { "min": 5, "max": 100, "currency": "sats" }
      },
      {
        "type": "subscription",
        "monthlyRate": 5000,
        "bolt12Offer": "lno1qgsq...",
        "currency": "sats"
      }
    ],
    "acceptedPayment": ["bolt11", "bolt12", "cashu", "l402"],
    "preferredPayment": "bolt12",
    "escrowRequired": true,
    "escrowMinDangerScore": 3,
    "acceptableMints": ["https://mint.minibits.cash"]
  }
}
```

### Payment Method Negotiation

When operator and advisor connect, they negotiate a payment method:

```
Operator preferred:  [bolt11, bolt12]
Advisor accepted:    [bolt11, bolt12, cashu, l402]
Negotiated:          bolt12 (first match in operator's preference that advisor accepts)

Exception: escrow payments always use Cashu regardless of preference
```

If no common non-escrow method exists, the client falls back to Cashu for all payments (since both parties must support Cashu for escrow anyway).

## CLN Plugins

### Overview

The CLN implementation consists of three independently installable Python plugins:

| Plugin | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **`cl-hive-comms`** | `cl_hive_comms.py` | Transport (Nostr DM + REST/rune), subscription management, marketplace publishing |
| **`cl-hive-archon`** | `cl_hive_archon.py` | DID identity, credentials, dmail, vault |
| **`cl-hive`** | `cl_hive.py` | Full hive coordination (gossip, topology, settlements) |

**`cl-hive-comms` is the entry point.** It can be installed standalone without the other plugins and is sufficient for commercial customers who want advisor management and marketplace access.

### cl-hive-comms Components

#### Schema Handler

Receives incoming management commands via **Nostr DM (NIP-44)** (primary transport) or **REST/rune** (secondary transport), validates the payload structure per the [Fleet Management spec](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md), and dispatches to the appropriate CLN RPC.

```python
# Primary transport: Nostr DM (NIP-44)
async def on_nostr_dm(sender_pubkey, decrypted_payload):
    msg = parse_management_message(decrypted_payload)
    return await handle_management_message(sender_pubkey, msg)

# Secondary transport: REST/rune (direct low-latency control, relay-down fallback)
@plugin.method("hive-comms-rpc")
def on_rpc_command(plugin, request, **kwargs):
    return handle_management_message(request["sender"], request["payload"])
```

The handler:
1. Deserializes the payload (schema_type, schema_payload, credential, payment_proof, signature, nonce, timestamp)
2. Passes to Credential Verifier (if `cl-hive-archon` installed, verifies DID; otherwise, verifies Nostr signature)
3. Passes to Policy Engine
4. If both pass, executes the schema action via CLN RPC
5. Generates signed receipt
6. Sends response via the same transport

#### Credential Verifier

Validates the credential attached to each management command. Verification level depends on installed plugins:

**Nostr-only mode** (cl-hive-comms only):
1. **Nostr signature verification** — Verifies the command is signed by the advisor's Nostr pubkey
2. **Scope check** — Confirms the credential grants the required permission tier
3. **Constraint check** — Validates parameters against credential constraints
4. **Replay protection** — Monotonic nonce check per agent pubkey. Timestamp within ±5 minutes.

**DID mode** (cl-hive-archon installed):
1. **DID resolution** — Resolves the agent's DID via local Archon Keymaster or remote Archon gateway
2. **Signature verification** — Verifies the credential's proof against the issuer's DID document
3. **Scope check** — Confirms the credential grants the required permission tier for the requested schema
4. **Constraint check** — Validates the command parameters against credential constraints (`max_fee_change_pct`, `max_rebalance_sats`, etc.)
5. **Revocation check** — Queries Archon revocation status. **Fail-closed**: if Archon is unreachable, deny. Cache with 1-hour TTL per the [Fleet Management spec](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md#credential-lifecycle).
6. **Replay protection** — Monotonic nonce check per agent DID. Timestamp within ±5 minutes.

#### Payment & Escrow Manager

Handles all payment flows. Delegates to the [Payment Manager](#payment-manager) for method selection, and manages the Cashu escrow wallet for conditional payments per the [Task Escrow protocol](./03-CASHU-TASK-ESCROW.md):

- **Method selection** — Chooses Bolt11/Bolt12/L402/Cashu based on context and preferences
- **Bolt11/Bolt12 payments** — Routes through the node's existing Lightning wallet
- **Cashu escrow tickets** — Mints tokens with P2PK + HTLC + timelock conditions for conditional payments
- **Secret management** — Generates and stores HTLC secrets, reveals on task completion
- **Auto-replenishment** — When escrow balance drops below threshold, auto-mints new tokens
- **Spending limits** — Enforces daily/weekly caps across all payment methods
- **Mint management** — Configurable trusted mints, multi-mint support
- **Receipt tracking** — Stores all completed task receipts locally

#### Policy Engine

The operator's last line of defense. Even with a valid credential and valid payment, the Policy Engine can reject any action based on local rules. See [Section 8: Local Policy Engine](#8-local-policy-engine) for full details.

#### Receipt Store

Append-only, hash-chained log of all management actions:

```json
{
  "receipt_id": 47,
  "prev_hash": "sha256:<hash_of_receipt_46>",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-14T12:34:56Z",
  "agent_did": "did:cid:<agent_did>",
  "schema": "hive:fee-policy/v1",
  "action": "set_anchor",
  "params": { "channel_id": "931770x2363x0", "target_fee_ppm": 150 },
  "result": "success",
  "state_hash_before": "sha256:<before>",
  "state_hash_after": "sha256:<after>",
  "agent_signature": "<sig>",
  "node_signature": "<sig>",
  "receipt_hash": "sha256:<hash_of_this_receipt>"
}
```

Tamper-evident: modifying any receipt breaks the hash chain. Receipts are stored in a local SQLite database with periodic merkle root computation for efficient auditing.

### RPC Commands

All commands accept **advisor names, aliases, or discovery indices** — not DIDs. DIDs are accepted via `--advisor-did` for advanced use.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `hive-client-status` | Active advisors, spending, policy | `lightning-cli hive-client-status` |
| `hive-client-authorize` | Grant an advisor access to your node | `lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "Hex Advisor" --access="fees"` |
| `hive-client-revoke` | Immediately revoke an advisor's access | `lightning-cli hive-client-revoke "Hex Advisor"` |
| `hive-client-receipts` | List management action receipts | `lightning-cli hive-client-receipts --advisor="Hex Advisor"` |
| `hive-client-discover` | Find advisors | `lightning-cli hive-client-discover --capabilities="fee optimization"` |
| `hive-client-policy` | View or modify local policy | `lightning-cli hive-client-policy --preset=moderate` |
| `hive-client-payments` | View payment balance and spending | `lightning-cli hive-client-payments` |
| `hive-client-trial` | Start or review a trial period | `lightning-cli hive-client-trial "Hex Advisor" --days=14` |
| `hive-client-alias` | Set a friendly name for an advisor | `lightning-cli hive-client-alias set "Hex" "did:cid:..."` |
| `hive-client-identity` | View or manage node identity | `lightning-cli hive-client-identity` (shows name, not DID) |

### Configuration

Most settings have sensible defaults. **Zero configuration is required for first run** — `cl-hive-comms` auto-generates a Nostr keypair and uses defaults for everything else.

```ini
# ~/.lightning/config (CLN config file)
# All cl-hive-comms settings are optional — defaults work out of the box.

# Nostr transport (primary)
# hive-comms-nostr-relays=wss://nos.lol,wss://relay.damus.io   # defaults
# hive-comms-nsec=nsec1...           # Only set if importing existing key
                                      # Otherwise, auto-generated on first run

# REST/rune transport (secondary — for direct low-latency control)
# hive-comms-rest-enabled=true        # default: true
# hive-comms-rest-port=9737           # default: 9737

# Payment methods (in preference order)
hive-comms-payment-methods=bolt11,bolt12
hive-comms-escrow-mint=https://mint.minibits.cash

# Spending limits
hive-comms-daily-limit=50000
hive-comms-weekly-limit=200000

# Policy preset (conservative | moderate | aggressive)
hive-comms-policy-preset=moderate

# Marketplace publishing
hive-comms-marketplace-publish=true   # Publish Nostr marketplace events (38380+/38900+)

# Optional feature toggles (same plugin boundary; no separate marketplace plugin)
# hive-comms-marketplace-enabled=true
# hive-comms-liquidity-enabled=true
# hive-comms-marketplace-subscribe=true
# hive-comms-liquidity-subscribe=true
# hive-comms-liquidity-publish=true

# Alerts (optional)
# hive-comms-alert-nostr-dm=npub1abc...

# --- cl-hive-archon settings (only if installed) ---
# hive-archon-gateway=https://archon.technology   # Lightweight tier
# hive-archon-gateway=http://localhost:4224        # Full tier (local node)
```

### Installation

```bash
# Minimal: just cl-hive-comms (entry point for commercial customers)
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive_comms.py

# Add DID identity later:
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive_archon.py

# Full hive membership:
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive.py
```

On first run, `cl-hive-comms` auto-generates a Nostr keypair, creates its data directory, and is ready to accept advisor connections. No DID setup. No key management. No configuration file edits required.

For permanent installation, add to your CLN config:

```ini
# Minimum viable setup:
plugin=/path/to/cl_hive_comms.py

# With DID identity (optional):
plugin=/path/to/cl_hive_archon.py

# Full hive member (optional):
plugin=/path/to/cl_hive.py
```

### Plugin Composition

The plugins form a layered architecture where each layer adds capabilities:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    cl-hive (coordination)              │

**Migration path:** See [Section 11: Hive Membership Upgrade Path](#11-hive-membership-upgrade-path).

## LND Support (Deferred)

> **LND implementation is deferred.** The initial implementation focuses exclusively on CLN plugins. An LND companion daemon (`hive-lnd`) is planned as a future, effectively separate project. The architecture principles, schema definitions, and protocol formats defined in this spec apply equally to LND — only the implementation layer differs (Go daemon with gRPC instead of Python plugin with JSON-RPC). The Schema Translation Layer in [Section 5](#5-schema-translation-layer) documents both CLN and LND RPC mappings for future reference.

---

## 5. Schema Translation Layer

The management schemas defined in the [Fleet Management spec](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md#core-schemas) are implementation-agnostic. The client translates each schema action to the appropriate CLN RPC call or LND gRPC call. This section defines the full mapping for all 15 schema categories.

### Translation Table

### Semantic Differences

| Area | CLN Behavior | LND Behavior | Handling |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Fee unit | `fee_proportional_millionths` | `fee_rate_milli_msat` (ppm) | Translation layer normalizes to ppm |
| Channel ID | Short channel ID (`931770x2363x0`) | Channel point (`txid:index`) OR `chan_id` (uint64) | Both formats supported; translation layer converts |
| HTLC resolution | `dev-` commands (developer mode) | `routerrpc.HtlcInterceptor` stream | Capability advertised per implementation |
| Splicing | Native support (v24.02+) | Experimental / not available | Advertised as unsupported on LND |
| Plugin management | Full lifecycle | Not applicable | Schema returns `unsupported` on LND |
| Runtime config | `setconfig` (extensive) | Limited runtime changes | Advertised capabilities differ |

### Feature Capability Advertisement

On startup, the client determines which schemas it can support based on the underlying implementation and version:

```json
{
  "implementation": "CLN",
  "version": "24.08",
  "supported_schemas": [
    "hive:monitor/v1",
    "hive:fee-policy/v1",
    "hive:rebalance/v1",
    "hive:config/v1",
    "hive:expansion/v1",
    "hive:channel/v1",
    "hive:splice/v1",
    "hive:peer/v1",
    "hive:payment/v1",
    "hive:wallet/v1",
    "hive:plugin/v1",
    "hive:backup/v1",
    "hive:emergency/v1",
    "hive:htlc/v1"
  ],
  "unsupported_actions": [
    { "schema": "hive:htlc/v1", "action": "fail_htlc", "reason": "--developer not enabled" }
  ]
}
```

The advisor queries capabilities before sending commands. Commands for unsupported schemas return an error response with `status: 2` and a reason string.

**Danger score preservation:** Danger scores are identical regardless of implementation. A `hive:fee-policy/v1 set_anchor` is danger 3 whether on CLN or LND. The Policy Engine uses the same scoring table from the [Fleet Management spec](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md#task-taxonomy--danger-scoring).

---

## 6. Credential Management (Client Side)

### Issuing Access (Management Credential)

The operator grants an advisor access to their node. Under the hood, this issues a `HiveManagementCredential` (per the [Fleet Management spec](./02-FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md#management-credentials)) — but the operator never sees the credential format.

```bash
# CLN — authorize by name (from discovery results)
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "Hex Fleet Advisor" --access="fee optimization"

# CLN — authorize by discovery index
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize 1 --access="full routing" --days=30

# LND (via hive-lnd CLI)
hive-lnd authorize "Hex Fleet Advisor" --access="fee optimization"

# Advanced: authorize by DID directly
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize --advisor-did="did:cid:bagaaiera..." --template="fee_optimization"
```

The credential is signed by the operator's identity (Nostr key or DID) and delivered to the advisor automatically via Nostr DM or REST/rune.

### Credential Templates

Pre-configured permission sets for common scenarios. Operators can use templates or define custom scopes.

| Template | Permissions | Schemas | Constraints | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `monitor_only` | `monitor` | `hive:monitor/*` | Read-only, no state changes | Dashboard, alerting, reporting |
| `fee_optimization` | `monitor`, `fee_policy` | `hive:monitor/*`, `hive:fee-policy/*`, `hive:config/fee_*` | `max_fee_change_pct: 50`, `max_daily_actions: 50` | Automated fee management |
| `full_routing` | `monitor`, `fee_policy`, `rebalance`, `config_tune` | `hive:monitor/*`, `hive:fee-policy/*`, `hive:rebalance/*`, `hive:config/*` | `max_rebalance_sats: 1000000`, `max_daily_actions: 100` | Full routing optimization |
| `complete_management` | All except `channel_close` | All except `hive:channel/close_*`, `hive:emergency/force_close_*` | `max_daily_actions: 200` | Full management minus nuclear options |

#### Custom Scope

For advanced users who need fine-grained control beyond templates:

```bash
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "Hex Fleet Advisor" \
  --access="custom" \
  --allow="monitoring,fees,rebalancing" \
  --max-fee-change=25 \
  --max-rebalance=500000 \
  --days=14
```

Under the hood, this maps to the full credential schema (`permissions`, `constraints`, `allowed_schemas`) — but the operator interface uses plain English and sensible parameter names.

### Credential Lifecycle

```
Issue ──► Active ──┬──► Renew ──► Active (extended)
                   │
                   ├──► Expire (natural end)
                   │
                   └──► Revoke (operator-initiated, immediate)
```

1. **Issue** — Operator creates and signs credential. Delivered to advisor.
2. **Active** — Advisor presents credential with each management command. Node validates.
3. **Renew** — Before expiry, operator issues a new credential with updated terms. Old credential superseded.
4. **Expire** — Credential's `validUntil` date passes. All commands rejected. No cleanup needed.
5. **Revoke** — Operator calls `hive-client-revoke`. Credential marked as revoked in Archon. All pending commands from this credential are rejected immediately.

### Multi-Advisor Support

Operators can issue credentials to multiple advisors with non-overlapping scopes:

```bash
# Advisor A: fee expert
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "Hex Fleet Advisor" --access="fee optimization"

# Advisor B: rebalance specialist
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "RoutingBot Pro" --access="custom" --allow="monitoring,rebalancing"

# Advisor C: monitoring only (dashboard provider)
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize "NodeWatch" --access="monitoring"
```

The Policy Engine enforces scope isolation — Advisor A cannot send `hive:rebalance/*` commands even if their credential somehow includes that scope, because the operator configured them for fee optimization only.

For multi-advisor coordination details (conflict detection, shared state, action cooldowns), see the [Marketplace spec, Section 6](./04-HIVE-MARKETPLACE.md#6-multi-advisor-coordination).

### Emergency Revocation

```bash
# Immediate revocation — all pending commands rejected
lightning-cli hive-client-revoke "Bad Advisor"

# Revoke ALL advisors (emergency lockdown)
lightning-cli hive-client-revoke --all
```

Revocation:
1. Marks credential as revoked locally (takes effect immediately for all pending/future commands)
2. Publishes revocation to Archon network (propagates to advisor and any verifier)
3. Logs the revocation event with reason in the Receipt Store
4. Sends alert via configured channels (webhook, Nostr DM, email)

The advisor's pending legitimate compensation (escrow tickets for completed work where the preimage was already revealed) is honored — the advisor can still redeem those tokens. Revocation only affects future commands.

---

## 7. Payment & Escrow Management (Client Side)

The client handles all payments to advisors through the [Payment Manager](#payment-manager). This section covers the operator-facing payment experience and the Cashu escrow subsystem.

### Payment Overview

Most advisor payments are simple Lightning transactions — the operator's node pays a Bolt11 invoice or subscribes via a Bolt12 offer. The client automates this within configured spending limits. **No special wallet or token management needed for standard payments.**

Cashu escrow is used only for **conditional payments** (danger score ≥ 3 by default) where payment must be contingent on task completion. The built-in Cashu wallet (NUT-10/11/14/07) handles escrow automatically.

### Ticket Creation Workflow (Escrow Only)

```
Operator                     Client Plugin               Cashu Mint
    │                             │                          │
    │  1. Advisor requests task   │                          │
    │  ◄──────────────────────    │                          │
    │                             │                          │
    │  2. Client auto-creates     │                          │
    │     escrow ticket:          │                          │
    │     - Generates HTLC secret │                          │
    │     - Computes H(secret)    │                          │
    │     - Mints Cashu token     │                          │
    │                      ───────────────────────────────►  │
    │                             │                          │
    │     - Token received        │                          │
    │                      ◄───────────────────────────────  │
    │                             │                          │
    │  3. Ticket sent to advisor  │                          │
    │     via Nostr DM            │                          │
    │  ──────────────────────►    │                          │
    │                             │                          │
```

For low-danger actions (score 1–2), the operator can configure **direct payment** (simple Cashu token, no HTLC escrow) to reduce overhead. For danger score 3+, full escrow is always used per the [Task Escrow spec](./03-CASHU-TASK-ESCROW.md#danger-score-integration).

### Auto-Replenishment

```yaml
escrow:
  replenish_threshold: 1000    # sats — trigger replenishment when balance drops below
  replenish_amount: 5000       # sats — amount to mint on replenishment
  replenish_source: "onchain"  # "onchain" (from node wallet) or "lightning" (via invoice)
  auto_replenish: true         # enable automatic replenishment
```

When auto-replenishment triggers:
1. Client checks node's on-chain wallet balance (or creates a Lightning invoice)
2. If sufficient funds, mints new Cashu tokens at the preferred mint
3. New tokens added to the escrow wallet
4. Operator notified via alert channel

**Safety:** Auto-replenishment respects `daily_limit` and `weekly_limit`. If the limit would be exceeded, replenishment is blocked and the operator is alerted.

### Spending Limits

| Limit | Default | Configurable | Enforcement |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Per-action cap | None (uses danger-score pricing) | Yes | Hard reject if exceeded |
| Daily cap | 50,000 sats | Yes | No new escrow tickets minted beyond cap |
| Weekly cap | 200,000 sats | Yes | No new escrow tickets minted beyond cap |
| Per-advisor daily cap | 25,000 sats | Yes | Per-advisor enforcement |

When a limit is reached, the client stops minting new escrow tickets and alerts the operator. The advisor receives a `budget_exhausted` error on their next command attempt.

### Mint Selection

```yaml
escrow:
  preferred_mint: "https://mint.minibits.cash"
  backup_mints:
    - "https://mint2.example.com"
  mint_health_check_interval: 3600  # seconds
```

The client periodically checks mint health (`GET /v1/info`) and switches to backup mints if the preferred mint is unreachable. Mint capabilities (NUT-10, NUT-11, NUT-14 support) are verified at startup.

### Receipt Tracking

All completed tasks generate receipts stored in the local Receipt Store:

```bash
# View recent receipts
lightning-cli hive-client-receipts --limit=10

# View receipts for a specific advisor (by name)
lightning-cli hive-client-receipts --advisor="Hex Fleet Advisor"

# Export receipts for auditing
lightning-cli hive-client-receipts --since="2026-02-01" --format=json > receipts.json
```

Each receipt links to the escrow ticket, the task command, the execution result, and the HTLC preimage (for completed tasks). This creates a complete audit trail of all management activity and its cost.

---

## 8. Local Policy Engine

### Purpose

The Policy Engine is the operator's **last line of defense**. Even if an advisor presents a valid credential, a valid payment, and a well-formed command, the Policy Engine can reject the action based on locally-defined rules. This is critical because:

- Credentials can be too permissive (operator granted broader access than intended)
- Advisors can make mistakes (valid action, bad judgment)
- Advisors can be adversarial (valid credential, malicious intent)

The Policy Engine enforces the operator's risk tolerance independent of the credential system.

### Default Policy Presets

| Preset | Philosophy | Max Fee Change/24h | Max Rebalance | Forbidden Actions | Confirmation Required |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `conservative` | Safety first | ±15% per channel | 100k sats | Channel close, force close, wallet send, plugin start | Danger ≥ 5 |
| `moderate` | Balanced | ±30% per channel | 500k sats | Force close, wallet sweep, plugin start (unapproved) | Danger ≥ 7 |
| `aggressive` | Maximum advisor autonomy | ±50% per channel | 2M sats | Wallet sweep, force close all | Danger ≥ 9 |

### Custom Policy Rules

Operators can define granular rules beyond the presets:

```json
{
  "policy_version": 1,
  "preset": "moderate",
  "overrides": {
    "max_fee_change_per_24h_pct": 25,
    "max_rebalance_sats": 300000,
    "max_rebalance_fee_ppm": 500,
    "forbidden_peers": ["03badpeer..."],
    "protected_channels": ["931770x2363x0"],
    "required_confirmation": {
      "danger_gte": 6,
      "channel_close": "always",
      "onchain_send_gte_sats": 50000
    },
    "rate_limits": {
      "fee_changes_per_hour": 10,
      "rebalances_per_day": 20,
      "total_actions_per_day": 100
    },
    "time_restrictions": {
      "quiet_hours": { "start": "23:00", "end": "07:00", "timezone": "UTC" },
      "quiet_hour_max_danger": 2
    }
  }
}
```

#### Protected Channels

Channels in the `protected_channels` list cannot be modified by any advisor. Fee changes, disabling, closing — all rejected. This is useful for critical channels with important peers.

#### Forbidden Peers

Advisors cannot open channels to, connect to, or route through nodes in the `forbidden_peers` list. Protects against advisors routing through known malicious nodes or competitors.

#### Quiet Hours

During quiet hours, only low-danger actions (monitoring, read-only) are permitted. This prevents advisors from making significant changes while the operator is sleeping.

### Confirmation Flow

When the Policy Engine requires confirmation (based on danger score or rule):

```
Advisor ──► Client Plugin ──► Policy Engine
                                    │
                              Requires confirmation
                                    │
                         ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                         │   Alert Operator     │
                         │   (webhook/Nostr/    │
                         │    email)            │
                         └──────────┬──────────┘
                                    │
                              Operator reviews
                                    │
                         ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                         │  Approve / Reject    │
                         │  (via RPC command)   │
                         └──────────┬──────────┘
                                    │
                              ┌─────┴─────┐
                              │           │
                           Approve     Reject
                              │           │
                           Execute    Reject + notify advisor
```

Pending confirmations expire after a configurable timeout (default: 24 hours for danger 5–6, 4 hours for danger 7–8). Expired confirmations are rejected.

```bash
# View pending confirmations
lightning-cli hive-client-status --pending

# Approve a pending action
lightning-cli hive-client-approve --action-id=47

# Reject a pending action
lightning-cli hive-client-approve --action-id=47 --reject --reason="Too aggressive"
```

### Alert Integration

The Policy Engine sends alerts for all advisor actions above a configurable threshold:

| Alert Level | Trigger | Channels |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **info** | Any action executed (danger 1–2) | Digest (daily summary) |
| **notice** | Standard actions (danger 3–4) | Real-time: webhook |
| **warning** | Elevated actions (danger 5–6) | Real-time: webhook + Nostr DM |
| **critical** | High/critical actions (danger 7+) | Real-time: webhook + Nostr DM + email |
| **confirmation** | Action requires approval | All channels + push notification |

Alert channels:

```yaml
alerts:
  webhook: "https://hooks.example.com/hive"
  nostr_dm: "npub1abc..."
  email: "operator@example.com"
  # Future: Telegram, Signal, SMS
```

### Policy Overrides

Operators can temporarily tighten or loosen policy:

```bash
# Temporarily tighten (e.g., during maintenance window)
lightning-cli hive-client-policy --override='{"max_danger": 2}' --duration="4h"

# Temporarily loosen (e.g., for a specific operation)
lightning-cli hive-client-policy --override='{"max_rebalance_sats": 2000000}' --duration="1h"

# Remove override (return to base policy)
lightning-cli hive-client-policy --clear-override
```

Overrides auto-expire after the specified duration. This prevents "forgot to undo the loose policy" scenarios.

---

## 9. Discovery for Non-Hive Nodes

Non-hive nodes cannot use hive gossip for advisor discovery. Four alternative mechanisms are supported, ordered by decentralization:

Non-hive nodes cannot use hive gossip for advisor discovery. The client searches multiple sources automatically and presents unified results. **The operator just types what they need — the client figures out where to look.**

```bash
# Simple search — client queries all available sources automatically
lightning-cli hive-client-discover --capabilities="fee optimization"
```

### Discovery Sources (Under the Hood)

The client searches multiple sources in parallel and merges results:

**1. Archon Network** — Queries for `HiveServiceProfile` credentials. Highest trust — profiles are cryptographically signed, reputation is verifiable.

**2. Nostr** — `cl-hive-comms` subscribes to advisor profile events (kind `38383`, tag `t:hive-advisor`) using the same Nostr connection it uses for DM transport. Medium trust — the client verifies the embedded credential signature and DID-to-Nostr binding (if cl-hive-archon is installed) or Nostr signature (Nostr-only mode). `cl-hive-comms` also handles **marketplace event publishing** (kinds 38380+/38900+) — see the [Nostr Marketplace spec](./05-NOSTR-MARKETPLACE.md).

**3. Curated Directories** — Optional web directories that aggregate profiles. Low trust for the directory; high trust for the verified credentials it surfaces.

**4. Direct Connection** — Operator has an advisor's contact info (from a website, conference, or recommendation):

```bash
# Add an advisor directly by their public identifier
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize --advisor-did="did:cid:bagaaiera..." --access="fee optimization"
```

**5. Referrals** — An existing client or advisor refers someone. Referral reputation is tracked per the [Marketplace spec, Section 8](./04-HIVE-MARKETPLACE.md#8-referral--affiliate-system).

All discovery results are ranked using the [Marketplace ranking algorithm](./04-HIVE-MARKETPLACE.md#filtering--ranking-algorithm) and presented as a simple numbered list (see [Discovery Output](#discovery-output) in the Abstraction Layer section).

## 10. Onboarding Flow

The entire flow from zero to managed node, as the operator experiences it:

### The Three-Command Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install cl-hive-comms
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive_comms.py

# 2. Find an advisor
lightning-cli hive-client-discover --capabilities="fee optimization"

# 3. Hire them
lightning-cli hive-client-authorize 1 --access="fee optimization"
```

Done. Your node is now professionally managed. Here's what happened behind the scenes:

1. **Install** → Plugin started, identity auto-provisioned, defaults configured
2. **Discover** → Searched Archon/Nostr/directories, verified credentials, ranked by reputation
3. **Authorize** → Issued a management credential, negotiated payment method, started trial period

### Detailed Flow (What the Client Does Automatically)

| Step | User Action | What Happens Internally |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Install plugin | `plugin start cl_hive_client.py` | DID auto-provisioned, Keymaster initialized, data directory created |
| Discover | `hive-client-discover` | Parallel queries to Archon + Nostr + directories, credential verification, reputation aggregation, ranking |
| Review | Read the results list | (Nothing — results already verified and ranked) |
| Authorize | `hive-client-authorize 1 --access="fees"` | Credential created and signed, payment method negotiated with advisor, credential delivered via Nostr DM, trial period started |
| Trial (automatic) | Wait 7–14 days | Advisor operates with reduced scope, client measures baseline, flat-fee payment via Bolt11 |
| Review trial | `hive-client-trial --review` | Metrics computed: actions taken, revenue delta, uptime, response time |
| Full access | `hive-client-authorize "Hex Advisor" --access="full routing"` | New credential with expanded scope, escrow auto-funded for conditional payments, full management begins |
| Ongoing | (Automatic) | Advisor manages node, payments auto-processed, Policy Engine enforces limits, receipts logged, alerts sent |

### What the Operator Never Does

- ~~Create a Nostr key~~ (auto-generated by cl-hive-comms)
- ~~Create a DID~~ (auto-provisioned by cl-hive-archon if installed)
- ~~Install Archon Keymaster~~ (bundled in cl-hive-archon, optional)
- ~~Configure credential schemas~~ (templates handle this)
- ~~Fund a Cashu wallet manually~~ (auto-replenishment from node wallet)
- ~~Verify cryptographic signatures~~ (automatic)
- ~~Resolve DID documents~~ (abstraction layer)
- ~~Manage payment tokens~~ (Payment Manager handles routing to Bolt11/Bolt12/Cashu)
- ~~Configure transport~~ (Nostr DM works out of the box, REST/rune auto-enabled)

## 11. Hive Membership Upgrade Path

Client-only nodes can upgrade to full hive membership when they want the benefits of fleet coordination.

### What Changes

| Aspect | `cl-hive-comms` only | + `cl-hive-archon` | + `cl-hive` (full member) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Software | Single plugin | Two plugins | Three plugins |
| Identity | Nostr keypair | Nostr + DID | Nostr + DID + hive PKI |
| Bond | None | None | 50,000–500,000 sats (per [Settlements spec](./06-HIVE-SETTLEMENTS.md#bond-sizing)) |
| Gossip | No participation | Full gossip network access |
| Settlement | Direct escrow only | Netting, credit tiers, bilateral/multilateral |
| Fleet rebalancing | N/A | Intra-hive paths (97% fee savings) |
| Pheromone routing | N/A | Full stigmergic signal access |
| Intelligence market | Buy from advisor directly | Full market access (buy/sell) |
| Management fees | Per-action / subscription | Discounted (fleet paths reduce advisor costs) |

### What Stays the Same

- Same management interface (schemas, custom messages, receipt format)
- Same credential system (management credentials work identically)
- Same escrow mechanism (Cashu tickets, same mints)
- Same advisor relationships (existing credentials remain valid)
- Same reputation history (reputation credentials are portable across membership levels)

### Migration Process

```bash
# Starting from cl-hive-comms only:

# 1. Add DID identity (optional but recommended before hive membership)
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive_archon.py
# → DID auto-provisioned, bound to existing Nostr key

# 2. Add full hive coordination
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/cl_hive.py

# 3. Join a hive and post bond
lightning-cli hive-join --bond=50000

# 4. Existing advisor relationships continue unchanged
lightning-cli hive-client-status  # same advisors, same credentials
```

Under the hood: each plugin layer adds capabilities without disrupting existing connections. The Nostr keypair generated by cl-hive-comms persists through the upgrade. DID binding is created automatically when cl-hive-archon is added.

### Incentives to Upgrade

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Fleet rebalancing paths | 97% cheaper than public routing (per cl-hive pheromone system) |
| Intelligence market access | Buy/sell routing intelligence with other hive members |
| Discounted management | Advisors pass on cost savings from fleet paths |
| Settlement netting | Bilateral/multilateral netting reduces escrow overhead |
| Credit tiers | Long-tenure members get credit lines, reducing pre-payment requirements |
| Governance participation | Vote on hive parameters, schema governance |

## 12. Security Considerations

### Attack Surface

The client plugin/daemon introduces a new attack surface on the node:

| Attack Vector | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| Malicious custom messages from non-advisors | Low — messages from unauthorized DIDs are rejected at credential check | Credential Verifier is the first check; messages without valid credentials never reach the Schema Handler |
| Compromised advisor credential | Medium — advisor could execute damaging actions within credential scope | Policy Engine limits blast radius; credential scope is narrow; revocation is instant |
| Compromised Archon Keymaster | High — attacker could issue credentials | Keymaster passphrase protection; key material never leaves the operator's machine |
| Malicious mint | Medium — escrow tokens could be stolen | Multi-mint strategy; operator controls which mints are trusted; pre-flight token verification |
| DID resolution poisoning | Low — attacker provides false DID documents | Multiple Archon gateways for verification; local cache with TTL |
| Policy Engine bypass | Critical if possible — but code is local, operator-controlled | Open-source auditable code; policy is enforced locally, not by the advisor |

### Malicious Advisor Protections

Assume the worst: the advisor is adversarial. Defense layers, from outermost to innermost:

1. **Credential scope** — The blast radius is limited to the schemas and constraints in the credential. A `fee_optimization` credential cannot close channels.

2. **Policy Engine** — Even within credential scope, the Policy Engine enforces operator-defined limits. Max fee change per period, max rebalance amount, forbidden peers, quiet hours.

3. **Spending limits** — Escrow expenditure is capped daily and weekly. An adversarial advisor cannot drain the operator's escrow wallet.

4. **Confirmation requirements** — High-danger actions require explicit operator approval. The advisor cannot auto-execute anything above the configured danger threshold.

5. **Rate limiting** — Actions are rate-limited per hour and per day. An advisor cannot flood the node with rapid-fire commands.

6. **Audit trail** — Every action is logged in the tamper-evident Receipt Store. The operator can review what the advisor did and when.

7. **Instant revocation** — One command (`hive-client-revoke`) immediately invalidates the advisor's credential. Fail-closed: if Archon is unreachable for revocation check, all commands are denied.

### What Advisors Can Never Do

Regardless of credential scope or Policy Engine configuration:

- **Access private keys** — The client never exposes node private keys, seed phrases, or HSM secrets to advisors
- **Modify the client software** — Advisors interact via the schema interface only; they cannot change plugin code or configuration
- **Bypass the Policy Engine** — Policy is enforced locally; the advisor has no mechanism to disable it
- **Access other advisors' credentials** — Multi-advisor isolation is enforced by the client
- **Persist access after revocation** — Revocation is instant and fail-closed

### Audit Log

The Receipt Store serves as a tamper-evident audit log:

- **Hash chaining** — Each receipt includes the hash of the previous receipt. Modifying any receipt breaks the chain.
- **Dual signatures** — Both the agent's DID and the node sign each receipt. Neither party can forge a receipt alone.
- **Periodic merkle roots** — Hourly/daily merkle roots are computed and optionally published (e.g., to Archon or Nostr) for external timestamping.
- **Export** — Receipts can be exported for independent audit at any time.

### Network-Level Security

- **Nostr DM encryption (NIP-44)** — Primary transport uses NIP-44 encryption. Management commands are encrypted end-to-end between node and advisor.
- **REST/rune authentication** — Secondary transport uses CLN rune-based authentication for direct connections.
- **No cleartext management traffic** — The client never sends management commands over unencrypted channels.
- **Bolt 8 encryption** — When Bolt 8 transport is added (deferred), it will use Noise_XK with forward secrecy.

## 12a. Backup & Recovery (cl-hive-archon)

### Overview

`cl-hive-archon` manages critical state: the node's DID, issued credentials, advisor authorizations, receipt chains, and Cashu escrow tokens. Loss of this state means loss of identity, loss of verifiable history, and potential loss of escrowed funds. The backup system uses **Archon group vaults** with an optional **Shamir threshold** layer for multi-operator recovery.

### What Gets Backed Up

| Data | Priority | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| DID wallet (identity + keys) | **Critical** | Archon vault | Without this, the node loses its identity |
| Credential store | **Critical** | Archon vault | Active advisor authorizations |
| Receipt chain (hash-linked log) | High | Archon vault + local SQLite | Tamper-evident audit trail |
| Nostr keypair | High | Archon vault | Transport identity; regenerable but loses continuity |
| Cashu escrow tokens | High | Archon vault | Unspent tokens = real sats |
| Policy configuration | Medium | Archon vault | Recreatable but tedious |
| Alias registry | Low | Archon vault | Convenience only |

### Vault Architecture

Backups use Archon's group vault primitive. A **group vault** is a DID-addressed container where members can store and retrieve encrypted items. `cl-hive-archon` creates a vault per node identity:

```
Node DID: did:cid:bagaaiera...
  └── Vault: hive-backup-<node-short-id>
       ├── Member: node DID (owner)
       ├── Member: operator DID (recovery)
       ├── Member: trusted-peer DID (optional)
       │
       ├── Item: wallet-backup-<timestamp>.enc
       ├── Item: credentials-<timestamp>.enc
       ├── Item: receipts-<timestamp>.enc
       ├── Item: escrow-tokens-<timestamp>.enc
       └── Item: config-<timestamp>.enc
```

### Backup Schedule

```ini
# cl-hive-archon config
hive-archon-backup-interval=daily       # daily | hourly | manual
hive-archon-backup-retention=30         # days to keep old backups
hive-archon-backup-vault=auto           # auto-create vault on first run
```

Backups are triggered:
1. **On schedule** (default: daily at 3 AM local)
2. **On critical state change** (new credential issued, credential revoked, escrow token created)
3. **On demand** (`lightning-cli hive-archon-backup`)

### Shamir Threshold Recovery

For operators who want distributed trust, `cl-hive-archon` supports **Shamir Secret Sharing** on top of the vault backup. The DID wallet encryption key is split into `n` shares with a threshold of `k`:

```ini
# Enable threshold recovery (optional)
hive-archon-threshold-enabled=true
hive-archon-threshold-k=2              # shares needed to recover
hive-archon-threshold-n=3              # total shares distributed
hive-archon-threshold-holders=did:cid:operator,did:cid:peer1,did:cid:peer2
```

**How it works:**

1. `cl-hive-archon` encrypts the wallet backup with a random symmetric key
2. The symmetric key is split into `n` Shamir shares
3. Each share is encrypted to a specific holder's DID (using Archon's DID-to-DID encryption)
4. Shares are stored as separate vault items, each readable only by its designated holder
5. The encrypted backup itself is stored in the vault (readable by any member)

**Recovery requires `k` holders to contribute their shares** — no single party (including the operator) can recover alone unless `k=1`.

```
Vault: hive-backup-<node>
  ├── wallet-backup-<ts>.enc          ← encrypted with random key K
  ├── share-1-<operator-did>.enc      ← Shamir share 1, encrypted to operator
  ├── share-2-<peer1-did>.enc         ← Shamir share 2, encrypted to peer 1
  └── share-3-<peer2-did>.enc         ← Shamir share 3, encrypted to peer 2
```

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hive-archon-backup` | Trigger immediate backup to vault |
| `hive-archon-backup-status` | Show last backup time, vault health, share holders |
| `hive-archon-restore` | Restore from vault (interactive — prompts for shares if threshold) |
| `hive-archon-rotate-shares` | Re-split and redistribute Shamir shares (e.g., after removing a holder) |
| `hive-archon-export` | Export backup locally (for offline/cold storage) |

### Recovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Routine Backup Restore (Single Operator)

**Situation:** Operator's node disk failed. They have a new machine with CLN installed.

**Prerequisites:** Operator controls their own DID (has their Archon wallet).

```bash
# 1. Install plugins
lightning-cli plugin start cl_hive_comms.py
lightning-cli plugin start cl_hive_archon.py

# 2. Import operator's Archon identity
lightning-cli hive-archon-import-identity --file=/path/to/operator-wallet.json

# 3. Restore from vault
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore
# → Finds vault by node DID
# → Decrypts backup with operator's DID key
# → Restores: DID wallet, credentials, receipts, escrow tokens, config
# → Re-establishes Nostr identity and advisor connections

# 4. Verify
lightning-cli hive-client-status
# → Shows restored advisors, active credentials, escrow balance
```

**Time to recovery:** ~5 minutes (excluding CLN sync).

#### Scenario 2: Single-Operator Recovery (No Threshold)

**Situation:** Operator lost their node AND their local Archon wallet backup, but their DID is still valid on the Archon network (not revoked).

**Prerequisites:** Operator remembers their Archon passphrase or has a recovery seed.

```bash
# 1. Recover Archon identity from seed/passphrase
npx @didcid/keymaster recover-id --seed="..."

# 2. Install plugins and restore (same as Scenario 1, steps 1-4)
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore
```

**If operator has no seed/passphrase:** → Scenario 4 (Lost DID Recovery).

#### Scenario 3: Threshold Recovery (k-of-n Shamir)

**Situation:** Operator cannot access the vault alone (threshold enabled, operator's share alone is insufficient, or operator lost their share entirely).

**Prerequisites:** `k` share holders are available and willing to participate.

```bash
# 1. Operator initiates recovery request
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --threshold

# 2. Plugin sends recovery request via Nostr DM to all share holders
#    (or via Archon dmail if available)
# → "Node <alias> is requesting threshold recovery. Please run:
#    lightning-cli hive-archon-contribute-share --request=<request-id>"

# 3. Each participating holder decrypts their share and sends it back
#    (encrypted to the operator's current session key)

# 4. Once k shares are collected, plugin reconstructs the symmetric key
# 5. Decrypts and restores the backup

# Alternative: manual share collection (offline)
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --threshold --manual
# → Prompts operator to paste k shares (base64-encoded)
```

**Security:** Shares are never transmitted in plaintext. Each share is encrypted to the requester's ephemeral session key. Share holders can verify the request originated from a known node DID (if still resolvable) or operator DID.

#### Scenario 4: Lost DID Recovery

**Situation:** Operator has lost their DID entirely — no wallet, no seed, no passphrase. The old DID exists on the Archon network but is inaccessible.

**This is the hardest scenario.** The old identity is cryptographically dead.

```bash
# 1. Create a new DID
lightning-cli plugin start cl_hive_archon.py
# → Auto-provisions new DID

# 2. If threshold was configured: request threshold recovery using new DID
#    Share holders can verify operator identity out-of-band (phone call, in-person)
#    and authorize recovery to the new DID
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --threshold --new-identity

# 3. If no threshold: manual recovery
#    - Contact each advisor to re-issue credentials to new DID
#    - Receipt chain: old chain is lost (new chain starts fresh)
#    - Escrow tokens: if Cashu tokens were backed up to vault and
#      threshold recovery succeeds, they can be reclaimed
#    - If escrow tokens are unrecoverable: negotiate with advisors
#      for token replacement or refund

# 4. Publish DID rotation notice (optional)
lightning-cli hive-archon-rotate-did --old="did:cid:old..." --new="did:cid:new..."
# → Issues a signed rotation credential (signed by new DID)
# → Advisors can verify if they trust the out-of-band identity proof
```

**Mitigation:** Operators should always keep an offline backup of their Archon wallet or seed phrase. Threshold recovery is insurance, not a replacement for basic key hygiene.

#### Scenario 5: Contested Recovery

**Situation:** A threshold recovery request is made, but some share holders suspect it's unauthorized (e.g., compromised operator machine, social engineering).

**Protections:**
1. **Share holders can refuse.** Each holder independently decides whether to contribute their share. No automated share release.
2. **Verification challenge.** Share holders can require out-of-band identity verification before contributing (e.g., video call, signed message from known channel, physical meeting).
3. **Time delay.** Operators can configure a mandatory delay between recovery request and share release (`hive-archon-threshold-delay=24h`), giving time for contested cases to be flagged.
4. **Revocation race.** If the real operator detects an unauthorized recovery attempt, they can:
   - Revoke the node DID immediately (`hive-archon-revoke-identity`)
   - Notify share holders to deny the request
   - Issue new credentials from a new DID

```ini
# Contested recovery protections
hive-archon-threshold-delay=24h        # mandatory wait before shares can be submitted
hive-archon-threshold-notify=all       # notify ALL holders when any recovery starts
```

#### Scenario 6: Partial Recovery (Degraded State)

**Situation:** Backup exists but is incomplete or corrupted. Some components restore, others don't.

| Component | If Missing | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| DID wallet | Identity lost | → Scenario 4 | Keep offline backup |
| Credentials | Advisors can't verify | Re-issue from advisors | Advisors retain copies |
| Receipt chain | Audit trail broken | New chain starts; gap noted | Receipts are append-only, partial chain still valuable |
| Nostr keypair | Transport identity lost | Regenerate; advisors re-add new npub | Publish key rotation on Nostr |
| Cashu tokens | Escrowed sats lost | Negotiate with advisors/mints | Small escrow balances; mints may have records |
| Policy config | Manual reconfiguration | Apply preset, customize | Export policy separately |
| Aliases | Convenience names lost | Re-add manually | Low impact |

**Partial restore command:**

```bash
# Restore only specific components
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --components=wallet,credentials
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --components=escrow
lightning-cli hive-archon-restore --skip=receipts  # skip corrupted component
```

### Design Principles

1. **Backups are automatic.** No operator action required after initial setup. `cl-hive-archon` backs up on state change and on schedule.
2. **Recovery is interactive.** Restoring always prompts for confirmation. No silent overwrites.
3. **Threshold is optional.** Single-operator vault access is the default. Shamir is for operators who want distributed trust.
4. **Archon is the vault, not the encryption.** Archon stores encrypted blobs. The encryption key is controlled by the operator (or split via Shamir). Archon never sees plaintext state.
5. **Fail-safe over fail-fast.** Partial recovery is always attempted. The system reports what succeeded and what failed, rather than aborting on first error.

### Cost Comparison

| Model | Upfront | Ongoing | Revenue Impact |
|-------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Unmanaged** | 0 sats | 0 sats | Baseline (leaving 50–200% revenue on table) |
| **Client** | 0 sats | 2,000–50,000 sats/month (per advisor pricing) | +50–300% revenue improvement (varies by advisor quality) |
| **Hive Member** | 50,000–500,000 sats (bond) | 1,000–30,000 sats/month (discounted via fleet) | +100–500% revenue improvement (fleet intelligence + cheaper rebalancing) |

Bond is recoverable (minus any slashing) on hive exit.

### Risk Comparison

| Risk | Unmanaged | Client | Hive Member |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Adversarial advisor | N/A | Policy Engine + credential scope + escrow limits | Same + bond forfeiture for hive-attested advisors |
| Fund loss from mismanagement | Self-inflicted | Limited by Policy Engine constraints | Same + fleet cross-checks |
| Privacy | Full control | Advisor sees channel data (within credential scope) | Hive sees aggregate data; advisor sees detail |
| Lock-in | None | None (switch advisors anytime) | Bond lock-up (6-month default) |
| Dependency | None | Advisor uptime (mitigated by monitoring fallback) | Advisor + hive infrastructure |

### When to Use Each Model

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Hobbyist, < 5 channels, no revenue goal | Unmanaged |
| Small-medium node, wants optimization, low commitment | **Client** with `fee_optimization` template |
| Medium node, wants full management, growing fleet | **Client** with `full_routing` template |
| Large routing node, wants fleet benefits, willing to post bond | **Hive Member** |
| Professional routing business, multiple nodes | **Hive Member** (founding/full) |

## 15. Open Questions

1. **Keymaster bundling size:** The bundled Archon Keymaster adds to the plugin/binary size. For Python (CLN), this means vendored dependencies. For Go (LND), this means a larger binary. What's the acceptable size budget? Can we use a minimal keymaster subset (just key generation + signing, no full node)?

2. **Auto-replenishment funding source:** Should auto-replenishment draw from the node's on-chain wallet (simple, requires on-chain funds) or via Lightning invoice (more complex, uses existing liquidity)? Both have tradeoffs.

3. **LND HTLC management:** LND lacks `dev-fail-htlc`-style commands. The `HtlcInterceptor` API provides similar functionality but requires the daemon to intercept all HTLCs, which has performance implications. Is this acceptable for production use?

4. **Policy Engine complexity:** How many custom rules are too many? A complex policy is harder to audit and may have unexpected interactions between rules. Should we limit the number of custom rules or provide rule conflict detection?

5. **Multi-implementation testing:** The Schema Translation Layer assumes specific RPC behavior from CLN and LND. How do we test correctness across both implementations, especially for edge cases (concurrent operations, error handling)?

6. **Advisor-side client library:** This spec focuses on the node operator's client. Should there be a corresponding advisor-side library/SDK that simplifies building advisors? Or is the schema spec sufficient?

7. **Offline operation:** If the Archon gateway is unreachable, the client denies all commands (fail-closed). This is safe but could deny service during Archon outages. Should there be a cached-credential mode for short outages, with degraded trust?

8. **Cross-implementation credentials:** A credential issued for a CLN node should work if the operator migrates to LND (same DID, same node pubkey). Are there edge cases where implementation-specific credential constraints break?

9. **Client-to-client communication:** Could client nodes discover and communicate with each other (e.g., for referral-based reputation, cooperative rebalancing) without full hive membership? This would create a "light hive" network.

10. **Tiered client product:** Should there be a free tier (monitor-only, limited discovery) and a paid tier (full management, priority discovery)? Or should the client software be fully open and free, with advisors as the only revenue source?

11. **Bolt12 adoption curve:** Bolt12 support varies across implementations. CLN has native support; LND's is experimental. Should the client gracefully degrade Bolt12 subscriptions to repeated Bolt11 invoices when Bolt12 isn't available?

12. **L402 vs Nostr DM:** L402 requires HTTP connectivity; the primary management channel is Nostr DM. Should L402 be limited to advisor web dashboards and monitoring APIs, or should there be a Nostr DM equivalent of L402 macaroon-gated access?

13. **Alias collision:** Two advisors could have the same display name. How should the alias system handle collisions? Auto-suffix (`"Hex Advisor"` → `"Hex Advisor (2)"`)? Require unique local aliases?
